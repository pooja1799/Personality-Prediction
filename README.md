# Personality-Prediction
The project is based on identifying the personality of an individual using machine learning algorithms and big 5 models. 
The personality of a human plays a major role in his personal and professional life.
The Big Five model is also known as the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and OCEAN model was developed in the early 1980s according to many psychological theories. When the statistical analysis is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe the person and these words give a summary of the overall character or personality of the person accurately.
